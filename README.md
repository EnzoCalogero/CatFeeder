# IoT Cat Food Scale Streaming to Google Cloud


## Quantify, analyze and monitor how much our cat is eating using the power of Google Cloud.

Our lovely cat is always begging for more food, and since we are not used to track how much he eats.... Our cat has periods of overfeeding and then under feeding.

Therefore, we decided to monitor the amount of food our cat was eating. So we create a weight measurement IoT device that log the weight and sent the measurement every 5 minutes to the cloud. Then, because was fun, we added the measurement of the room temperature, humidity and amount of light.
